        From the moment you get the news that you are pregnant, you will probably be filled with a rush of emotions 
         and most likely a flood of questions too. While the first trimester of pregnancy is filled with a host of changes 
         for you and for your baby, many will be invisible to the outside world.
         From the time of conception, your baby will grow and change inside your uterus until he or she is born. 
        Each trimester has a unique set of milestones. In the first trimester, your baby will grow from a fertilized egg 
        into a moving fetus with eyes, ears, and working organs. In the second trimester, your baby’s features develop and 
        you may be able to feel your baby move. In the third trimester, your baby will grow rapidly to get ready for birth.

Your doctor will calculate your estimated due date during your first prenatal care visit. It will be about 40 weeks from 
the first day of your last menstrual period. Even though your baby is not conceived until about 2 weeks after you start your 
period, week 1 of your pregnancy is considered to be the week of your menstrual period.
Your first trimester lasts until the end of week 12. The second trimester lasts from week 13 to the end of week 26. 
Your third trimester is from week 27 until birth. Most babies are born between weeks 38 and 42. 
Read on to find out what happens to your body and how to stay healthy.

    <p>
        Trimesters are a helpful way to think about pregnancy because the changes that happen to you and your baby fall into
         the 3 broad categories of early, middle and late pregnancy,
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>
        <strong>First Trimester (Weeks 0-12)</strong>
    </h2>
    Your baby is conceived when a sperm cell penetrates the egg. This happens around the end of week 2 of your pregnancy.
     It is at this moment that your baby’s sex is determined. This depends on whether
     the sperm cell was carrying an X chromosome (a baby girl) or a Y chromosome (a baby boy).
    For some women, the first trimester is characterised by nausea (often called ‘morning sickness’, although it can occur 
    at any time of day). But remember that every pregnancy is different and while some women have food cravings, others 
    experience food aversions, and some have no change in appetite at all. 
    Other changes in the first trimester include changes to your breasts as they become tender, larger and heavier, 
    while your uterus will grow and put pressure on your bladder so that you need to urinate more often.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>YOUR EMOTIONS</strong>
You might feel a range of emotions during your first trimester. Hormone changes may make you feel moody or irritable, 
and tiredness is common in the early months. These feelings are normal, so discuss how you feel with you partner or with a
 close friend. If you feel down or anxious, speak with your doctor or midwife.
What happens to the baby?
Through the first trimester, your baby goes from being a fertilised ovum to a fetus of about 6cm in length at 12 weeks. 
By the end of the first trimester, your baby’s heart is starting to beat, and the brain, stomach and intestines are developing.
There are little bumps known as 'buds' where arms and legs are starting to grow.

<strong>WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED FROM THE DOCTOR AND MIDWIFE</strong>
Your antenatal (pregnancy) health checks might be with your GP, a midwife or an obstetrician, depending on where you will give birth.
 During your first antenatal health check, you will probably have your pregnancy confirmed with a urine or blood test. These are more
  reliable than home pregnancy tests. First trimester antenatal health checks usually happen every 4 to 6 weeks, but this can vary, 
  based on your health and how your baby develops.
Many women are offered an ultrasound scan at around 12 weeks – you might hear the baby’s heartbeat at this scan. This ultrasound will
also show if you are having a multiple birth (e.g. twins) and can help estimate the baby’s size and due date, as well as check for some 
health conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Other health checks during the first trimester include:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        

<stong><em>urine tests</em></stong>to detect urinary infections, a common but manageable condition that if left untreated can trigger pre-term labour

<stong><em>Blood tests</em></stong> to check your blood type (particularly Rh status), iron levels, blood sugars (for gestational diabetes), rubella 
(German measles) immunity, and other infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis
<stong><em>General maternal health and wellbeing checks</em></stong>, including a discussion of concerns you might have about your pregnancy or general health, and a medication review (including natural or alternative medicines) to check for safety during pregnancy
    </li>
</ul>
